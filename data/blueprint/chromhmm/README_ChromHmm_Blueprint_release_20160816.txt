Analysis name: ChromHmm Segmentation of ChIP-Seq data

Analysis description:
  A model with 12 states was generated for 91 samples from healthy donors that had the complete histone modifications set and the input (information about samples used to generate the model summarized in table "index.segmented.healthy.model.csv").
  This model was then used to segment the 91 cell types used in model plus 82 additional cell types with the complete histone modifications set and the input, including 7 cell lines, 9 additional healthy donors and samples from 66 patients with diseases of the haematopietic system.

Command line:


	1. Data Binarization: Chip-seq data is binarized in 200bp with BinarizeBam function from ChromHmm package v1.11 (BinarizeBam and BinarizeBed functions produce the same binary output)
	
	 java -mx20G -jar /<path>/ChromHMM.jar BinarizeBam -c <controldir> /<path>/ChromHMM/CHROMSIZES/hg38.txt <inputbeddir> <datafile>  <outputbinarydir>


   Files required:
      A. Control aligment files
      B. Histone modification aligment files
      C. File with chromosome sizes. A two column tab delimited file with the first column being the chromosome and the 
         second being the chromosome length (hg38.txt can be found in CHROMSIZES directory where ChromHmm was installed)
      D. Data file. A tab delimited file each row contains the cell type or other identifier for a groups of marks, 
         then the associated mark, then the name of a bed file, and optionally a corresponding control bed file. Example:

           C000S5H1	H3K4me3	C000S5H1.ERX149093.H3K4me3.dedup.bwa.GRCh38.20150504.bam	C000S5H1.ERX675826.Input.dedup.bwa.GRCh38.20150503.bam
