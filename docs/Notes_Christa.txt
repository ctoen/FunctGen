## Stuff to do  

## Stuff to discuss with Siebren/Siemon/Klaas:  
1. UCSC GB: 
  - use track hub or download & modify data ourselves
  - what failed trakc to use?


## Optional Questions:  
1. Possible explanations for having identified genomic regions in ChIP-seq experiment that do not include at least one binding site for the target protein/protein of interest:
  
- not perfect antibody or cross-reactivity of the antibody - should actually have been tested up front!
- protein/IP target may not bind directly to identified DNA region  
- 
- never perfect analysis pipelines and too low signal cutoff thresholds
