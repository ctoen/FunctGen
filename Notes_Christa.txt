# Personal notes from Christa  

## Stuff to remember  
Genome Browser explanation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673602/

## Stuff to do  

## Stuff to discuss with Siebren/Siemon/Klaas:  
1. UCSC GB: 
- include RNA-seq? Can't find   
- include Table Browser UCSC?  
- Where to find TSSs?  

## Optional Questions:  
1. Possible explanations for having identified genomic regions in ChIP-seq experiment that do not include at least one binding site for the target protein/protein of interest:
  
- not perfect antibody or cross-reactivity of the antibody - should actually have been tested up front!
- protein/IP target may not bind directly to identified DNA region  
- 
- never perfect analysis pipelines and too low signal cutoff thresholds

## additional explanation  
ENCODE is a project by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) that is identifying and characterizing all functional elements in human genome sequences.
By "intersection", we mean determining overlap (or absence of overlap) between the genomic positions of items in two tables.
